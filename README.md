# Detection-of-Fraudulent-Healthcare-Providers

This project aims to predict potential fraudulent healthcare providers by analyzing their filed claims and identifying key variables crucial for detecting their behavior. The datasets, encompassing Inpatient claims, Outpatient claims, and Beneficiary details, were utilized to build machine learning models. 

Among various models, the XGBoost algorithm demonstrated superior predictive performance. The finalized model was seamlessly integrated into an end-to-end solution using Streamlit in Python. This comprehensive system takes in test and train datasets, classifying providers in the test dataset into distinct levels based on the predicted probability of being a fraudulent healthcare provider.
